# Sass-Demo

This e-Portfolio is a small introduction to Sass, a script language to simplify creating CSS files.
The live demo starts with a html and an "empty" Sass file. You can find them in the html folder. We will style a table using some basic functions to see how they work.

# Requirements for the demo

For using Sass you have to prepare the following steps:

- At fist you have to install Ruby, for Windows the easiest way is [here](https://rubyinstaller.org/).
- To install Sass finally, you have to open a console and enter the command line:
  "gem install sass"
- Clone the html folder of the repo.
- Type "sass --watch <path_to_html_folder>" in the console. This will automatically create CSS files from all Sass files in the folder while running.
